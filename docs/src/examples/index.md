# Examples

This page contains some self-contained examples to demonstrate possible usecases of the
DCCP algorithm. The notebook source files are also available on GitHub at [dccp/examples](https://github.com/cvxgrp/dccp/tree/master/examples).

These examples are also discussed in the [DCCP paper](https://stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/dccp.html).
